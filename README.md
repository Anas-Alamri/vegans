# VeGANs

A library providing various existing GANs in PyTorch.

This library targets two kinds of users:
* GAN users, who want to use existing GAN training techniques with their own generators/discriminators.
* Researchers, who want may find the GAN base class useful for quicker implementation of new GAN training techniques.
